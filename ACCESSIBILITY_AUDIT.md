# CareSupport Accessibility Audit & Improvements

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies critical accessibility barriers in the CareSupport application and provides production-ready solutions following WCAG 2.1 AA+ guidelines. The focus is on inclusive design patterns that work for users with diverse abilities in high-stress caregiving scenarios.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Navigation & Focus Management
- **Issue**: Bottom navigation lacks proper focus indicators and keyboard navigation
- **Impact**: Users with motor disabilities cannot navigate effectively
- **Severity**: High

### 2. Voice Input Accessibility
- **Issue**: Voice recording interface lacks alternative input methods
- **Impact**: Users with speech disabilities cannot access core functionality
- **Severity**: Critical

### 3. Color-Only Information
- **Issue**: Status indicators rely solely on color (red/green/yellow)
- **Impact**: Color-blind users cannot distinguish task states
- **Severity**: High

### 4. Complex Interactions
- **Issue**: Multi-step modals and forms lack clear progress indicators
- **Impact**: Users with cognitive differences may lose context
- **Severity**: Medium

### 5. Touch Target Sizes
- **Issue**: Many interactive elements are below 44px minimum
- **Impact**: Users with motor impairments struggle with precise targeting
- **Severity**: Medium

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Bottom Navigation Component
**Current Issues:**
- No focus management between tabs
- Missing ARIA labels and roles
- Insufficient touch target sizes
- No keyboard navigation support

**Accessibility Barriers:**
- Screen reader users cannot understand navigation context
- Keyboard users cannot navigate between tabs
- Motor-impaired users struggle with small touch targets

### Voice Input Screen
**Current Issues:**
- No alternative input methods for users who cannot speak
- Missing transcription editing capabilities
- No keyboard shortcuts for recording controls
- Insufficient error handling for speech recognition failures

**Accessibility Barriers:**
- Users with speech disabilities excluded from core feature
- Users in noisy environments cannot use voice input effectively
- No fallback for speech recognition errors

### Task Cards and Status Indicators
**Current Issues:**
- Status communicated only through color
- Missing semantic markup for task states
- No alternative text for visual indicators
- Insufficient contrast ratios in some states

**Accessibility Barriers:**
- Color-blind users cannot distinguish task priorities
- Screen reader users miss important status information
- Low vision users struggle with contrast
