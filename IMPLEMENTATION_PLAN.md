# CareSupport Schedule Page Refactor - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the refactoring of CareSupport's Schedule page to focus on the core MVP: streamlined availability input, clear coverage visualization, and basic coordination tools. The goal is to solve the fundamental problem of getting users to effectively input availability and enabling coordinators to manage coverage gaps.

## Current State Analysis

### Inferred Current Design Structure
Based on the existing codebase, the current Schedule page likely includes:

**Layout Structure:**
- Tab-based navigation (Dashboard, Shifts, Availability)
- Multiple view modes (day, week, month)
- Complex grid-based shift visualization
- Separate availability management screens

**Key Features:**
- Shift creation and management
- Coverage gap detection
- Team member assignment
- Handoff note management
- Recurring shift patterns

**User Interaction Patterns:**
- Multiple clicks to set availability
- Complex forms for shift creation
- Separate screens for different functions
- Heavy reliance on modals and overlays

### Identified Pain Points

**Usability Issues:**
1. **Fragmented Experience**: Availability input is separated from coverage visualization
2. **Complex Navigation**: Too many tabs and sub-screens
3. **Cognitive Overload**: Too much information presented simultaneously
4. **Inefficient Workflows**: Multiple steps required for simple actions

**Information Hierarchy Problems:**
1. **Buried Critical Information**: Coverage gaps not prominently displayed
2. **Unclear Status Indicators**: Difficult to distinguish between confirmed/unconfirmed coverage
3. **Poor Visual Hierarchy**: Equal weight given to all information

**Mobile Responsiveness:**
1. **Grid Complexity**: Shift grids don't work well on mobile
2. **Touch Target Issues**: Small interactive elements
3. **Horizontal Scrolling**: Required for time-based views

**Accessibility Gaps:**
1. **Color-Only Information**: Status communicated only through color
2. **Poor Focus Management**: Unclear navigation paths
3. **Missing ARIA Labels**: Screen reader compatibility issues

## Refactored Solution Design

### 1. Simplified Information Architecture

```
Schedule Page
├── Coverage Overview (Primary View)
│   ├── Today's Coverage Status
│   ├── Critical Gaps (Highlighted)
│   └── Quick Actions
├── My Availability (Secondary)
│   ├── Quick Status Toggle
│   ├── Calendar Input
│   └── Recurring Patterns
└── Team Coordination (Tertiary)
    ├── Request Coverage
    ├── Assign Shifts
    └── Send Notifications
```

### 2. Enhanced User Experience Flows

**For Caregivers (Availability Input):**
1. Land on simple status toggle (Available/Tentative/Unavailable)
2. Optional: Set specific dates via calendar
3. Optional: Set recurring patterns
4. Immediate visual confirmation of changes

**For Coordinators (Coverage Management):**
1. See coverage overview with gaps highlighted
2. Click gap to see available team members
3. One-click to request availability or assign
4. Real-time updates as responses come in

### 3. Modern UI Patterns

**Coverage Visualization:**
- Card-based layout instead of complex grids
- Color-coded status with text labels and icons
- Progressive disclosure for detailed information
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Availability Input:**
- Toggle switches for quick status changes

- Floating action buttons for primary actions
- Contextual menus for secondary actions
- Toast notifications for status updates
- Batch operations for efficiency

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Logical tab order throughout all components
- Arrow key navigation for calendar grids
- Escape key to close modals and overlays
- Enter/Space for activation

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- Alternative text for visual indicators

**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast mode support
- Text alternatives to color coding
- Scalable text and UI elements
- Clear focus indicators

**Motor Accessibility:**
